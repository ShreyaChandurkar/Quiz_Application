# Quiz_Application
I have developed a quiz application using core Java concepts and Java Swing. The application starts with a login page where users can enter their name. Upon clicking the "Rules" button, they are redirected to the rules form. Once on the rules form, users can click the "Start" button to begin the test.

The test consists of a total of 10 questions, each containing four options. A time limit of 30 seconds is given for each question. Once the user clicks the next button, they cannot revisit the previous question.

To provide some assistance, I have included a lifeline called the "50-50 lifeline." Users can use this lifeline once during the test, and it will disable two options that are incorrect, leaving only two options for the user to choose from.

After the time limit for a particular question is over, the application automatically moves to the next question. This ensures a smooth flow through the quiz without allowing users to go back to previous questions.

Once the user has answered all 10 questions, they can submit the test. The application then displays a score page, showing the user's score in the quiz.To exit the exam, the user can simply click on the "EXIT" button.
